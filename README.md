<h3>Stallman RPG HTML5 / JavaScript Game</h3>

<h4>Mission</h4>

A /g/ project born of our love for RMS and on the backs of broken dreams and other unfinished Stallman projects - The Stallman RPG game will be an opensource project built with HTML5 and JavaScript and ultimately 'published' from a GNU OS using free software.

<h4>The Game</h4>

The game will consist of an opening intro, title screen, a top-down GTA style driving mission mixed with RPG elements like NPC interaction and dialogue, and concluding with RPG turn-based battle. The original Flash alpha can be viewed <a href="http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1371783390">here</a>.

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

Collaboration is welcome, view the current stage of development in the Wiki and if you can address any missing features, get in touch!

As an open source project we would like to depend on github - collaborators are encouraged to catch up on it's use if unfamiliar - please be aware that use of github is a polite lithmus test to involvement in the project. 


<h4>Development Stages</h4>

Develop a working framework in HTML5 and JavaScript for the entire game from start to finish, using placeholder graphics where necessary to save time. Clean and functional code for all main stages of the game is the first priority. **Contributors will be most welcome here ** - for direction on how to help please visit our IRC channel (coming soon).

The OP will replace the placeholder graphics with polished graphics of a uniform style - in some instances including the creation of bosses or special characters contributors may be encouraged to put up some character designs which /g/ can decide on.

The OP will handle Sound FX and Music.

The GUI will then be added, visual and sound fx polished.

General debugging until /g/ has determined project to be complete.

<h4>Deployment</h4>

We will release the game online through multiple websites and will also release a free Android app.
