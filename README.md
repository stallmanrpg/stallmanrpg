Mission

A /g/ project born of our love for RMS and on the backs of broken dreams and other unfinished Stallman projects - The Stallman RPG game will be an opensource project built with HTML5 and JavaScript and ultimately 'published' from a GNU OS using free software.

The Game

The game will consist of an opening intro, title screen, a top-down GTA style driving mission mixed with RPG elements like NPC interaction and dialogue, and concluding with RPG turn-based battle. The original Flash alpha can be viewed here.

Collaboration

As an open source project we will depend heavily on github - collaborators are encouraged to catch up on it's use if unfamiliar - please be aware that use of github is a polite lithmus test to involvement in the project.

Developers can contact me through the stallmanrpg blog via http://stallmanrpg.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/github/

Development Stages

We've adopted the MelonJS framework in HTML5 and JavaScript for the entire game from start to finish, using placeholder graphics where necessary to save time. Clean and functional code for all main stages of the game is the first priority.

The OP will replace the placeholder graphics before completion with polished graphics of a uniform style - in some instances including the creation of bosses or special characters contributors may be encouraged to put up some character designs which /g/ can decide on.

The OP will handle Sound FX and Music.

The GUI is added and polished.

General debugging until /g/ has determined project to be complete.

Deployment

We will release the game online through multiple websites and will also release a free Android app.
